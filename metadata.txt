      * Supports QT6
      **Bug Fixes & Functional Improvements**  
      * **Import tool**:  
      ** Fixed bug affecting import of data if a geometry column exists in the imported shapefile and in the absence of a kinematics column for structural data.
      ** Fixed bug with multiple display of warning boxes. 
    3.1.4 2025-08
      * Updated the plugin to support retrieval of the latest version (v3.1.4) from the Zenodo repository  
      * Improved compatibility checks: added warnings or approval messages when opening the plugin against different template versions  
      * Implemented pre- and postflight checks to detect excessively long filenames (≥256 characters) that may trigger Python errors on Windows; applied to the following tools: Rejig, Clip, Merge, Save QLR, Export, and SyncQFieldToQGIS  
      * Harmonised and improved tooltips across all plugin buttons  
      * Refined behaviour of “Reset Window” buttons  
      * Minor GUI improvements  
      * Corrected links in the Help tab

      * **Merge Projects tool**:  
      ** Fixed bug affecting merging of projects with modified names (e.g., subsets of a master project)  
      ** Automatically generates merged project filename based on shared name substrings (≥5 characters); defaults to `Merged.qgz` otherwise  
      * **Clip tool**:  
      ** Automatically generates the list of project folders to copy, removing reliance on the hard-coded `cp_dirs` list  
      * **Save Style Template tool**:  
      **Resolved bug affecting the saving process  
      * **Photograph Management tool**:  
      ** EXIF data is now correctly retrieved and written to the Image Direction field (logic block fixed)  
      * **Import FieldMove Project tool**:  
      ** Now creates a dedicated subfolder to store generated scratch layers  
      **Shapefile Import Tool – Enhancements**  
      * Created subfolders for scratch layer outputs  
      * Fixed issue when importing legacy data lacking lithological information  
      * Added management of structural lineations  
      * Improved warning messages  
      **New Functionalities**  
      * **New tool in the Data Management tab** to synchronise a QField package (ZIP or folder) to the GEOL-QMAPS QGIS master project (creates a local copy)  
      * **New tool in the Data Management tab** to update the current GEOL-QMAPS QGIS project to the latest version of the template hosted on Zenodo  
    3.1.3 2025-04
      **Updated import tool**
      * add tester code for non-import functionality
      * GUI tweaks
