changelog=3.1.4

* Updated the plugin to support retrieval of the latest version (v3.1.4) from the Zenodo repository  
* Improved compatibility checks: added warnings or approval messages when opening the plugin against different template versions  
* Implemented pre- and postflight checks to detect excessively long filenames (≥256 characters) that may trigger Python errors on Windows; applied to the following tools: Rejig, Clip, Merge, Save QLR, Export, and SyncQFieldToQGIS  
* Harmonised and improved tooltips across all plugin buttons  
* Refined behaviour of “Reset Window” buttons  
* Minor GUI improvements  
* Corrected links in the Help tab  

**Bug Fixes & Functional Improvements**  
* **Merge Projects tool**:  
  – Fixed bug affecting merging of projects with modified names (e.g., subsets of a master project)  
  – Automatically generates merged project filename based on shared name substrings (≥5 characters); defaults to `Merged.qgz` otherwise  
* **Clip tool**:  
  – Automatically generates the list of project folders to copy, removing reliance on the hard-coded `cp_dirs` list  
* **Save Style Template tool**:  
  – Resolved bug affecting the saving process  
* **Photograph Management tool**:  
  – EXIF data is now correctly retrieved and written to the Image Direction field (logic block fixed)  
* **Import FieldMove Project tool**:  
  – Now creates a dedicated subfolder to store generated scratch layers  

**Shapefile Import Tool – Enhancements**  
* Created subfolders for scratch layer outputs  
* Fixed issue when importing legacy data lacking lithological information  
* Added management of structural lineations  
* Improved warning messages  

**New Functionalities**  
* **New tool in the Data Management tab** to synchronise a QField package (ZIP or folder) to the GEOL-QMAPS QGIS master project (creates a local copy)  
* **New tool in the Data Management tab** to update the current GEOL-QMAPS QGIS project to the latest version of the template hosted on Zenodo
